# Delite first tutorial


## background
what this project is for and where it's come from, dojo history
> How do we describe migration from dojo/dijit here? Describe the issues historically seen with Dojo?
Politically this could be sensitive but.. we are moving to a much less monolithic, more federated/loosely connected & interchangeable
core framework which provides the core features for current and future web standards.


> Actually, what is delite for? What are the basic concepts seeing as decor has been created and there's still some `widgets` in delite
(which are obviously legacy and yet to be ported). Is this a dijit core?

### why delite is important
es5/6 and html5 etc concepts

## aims
what this tutorial will end up showing (this needs to be in the form of a problem description/statement):

- Do a more advanced todomvc example? e.g.
    - a "shopping cart" store to demonstrate stores and 2 way binding
    - custom elements used for basic templating
    - handlebars used for more advanced templating
    - themeing

- or do some other type of tutorial, flickerview? a shopping cart?
    - to be honest I didn't really like flickerview
