# Delite first tutorial


## background summary
what this project is for and where it's come from, Dojo history
> Describe the issues historically seen with Dojo?
Politically this could be sensitive but.. we are moving to a much less monolithic, more federated/loosely connected & interchangeable
core framework which provides the core features for current and future web standards.
<br>
Migration from Dojo/Dijit here for existing users (link to the migration docs)?



> Actually, what is delite for? What are the basic concepts seeing as decor has been created and there's still some `widgets` in delite
(which are obviously legacy and yet to be ported).
Is this a Dijit core? Can/should users use delite on it's own (by that I mean without deliteful, I think yes?)

### why delite is important summary
For new and migrating users i.e. es5/6 and html5 etc concepts

## aims
what this tutorial will end up showing (this needs to be in the form of a problem description/statement):

- Do a more advanced todomvc example? e.g.
    - a "shopping cart" store to demonstrate stores and 2 way binding
    - custom elements used for basic templating
    - handlebars used for more advanced templating
    - themeing
    - form elements? *
    - popups? *
    - scrolling? *
    - (*) not sure if these would be directly used by end users but why not?

- or do some other type of tutorial,  a shopping cart?
    - flickerview? to be honest I didn't really like flickerview
    - a shopping cart?
    - a banking/e-commerce example? e.g. money transfers
