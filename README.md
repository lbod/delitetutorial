# delitetutorial

This is an in-progress project to show a [delite](https://github.com/ibm-js/delite) tutorial .

## Status

No official release yet & nothing to see here yet, this is purely a structural example

## docs
Not sure what this tutorial should be yet, it's first just an example of structure to demonstrate what it could look like.

Obviously we'll need an aim for the tutorial, that's yet to be discussed.
